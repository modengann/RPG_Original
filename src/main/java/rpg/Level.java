/**
 * A <code>Level</code> represents a single section of a town, dungeon, or
 * the outdoors in Project RPG.
 * 
 * In part 2 of this project, you will make <code>Level</code> able to maintain
 * a list of all the <code>Script</code>s in it. This will require you to be
 * able to add and remove from that list, and to search through your list for
 * scripts that match a certain template. A Level is an interesting sort of list
 * because there is no way simply to view all the scripts in it; instead, you
 * must always provide it with a template for the sort of scripts you are
 * interested in seeing.
 * 
 * In part 3 of this project, you will make <code>Level</code> load itself from
 * a file. This will require you to write a "factory" method in the
 * <code>Script</code> class that will construct a new <code>Script</code> from
 * a single <code>String</code>. It will also require you to load the information
 * on the dimensions of the level, and the hexadecimal encoding of the tiles,
 * from that same file. In this section you will add some instance variables and
 * their getters.
